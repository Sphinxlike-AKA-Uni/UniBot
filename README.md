Uni discord bot to do things

## About
Just another bot to do entertaining things to add some spice to your server
#####
She can be invited with this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=462421724659580950&scope=bot&permissions=535948390)

### What can uni do?
If enabled she will have the ability to request posts from a subreddit, grab an image from the [inspirobot](http://inspirobot.me/), search for random images off derpibooru with the given tags.
Although more features may come


## Syntax?
Uni was formed to not use character prefixes. Mainly uni will have all of her commands under `hey uni`.

## How do I enable these modules?
It's simple first you have to be the server owner or have the set admin role (look in admin section)
#####
To enable a module do
`hey uni enable module <module name here>`
available modules are
* reddit
* derpi
* inspire
* minigames
* unibucks
* miscellaneous (coming soon, dunno what to put here honestly)
* OwO (Coming soon, basically just an "owo-ifer")

## What if I want to disable these?
Almost similar to enabling them. All you have to do is `hey uni disable module <module name>`
#####

## Usage of the reddit module
##### To grab any current posts do 
```
hey uni find a post <in/on/from/within> <r/, /r/, or just the name of the subreddit>
```
Example:
```
hey uni find a post in r/yesyesyesno
```

##### For top posts:

```
hey uni find a top post <in/on/from/within> <r/, /r/, or just the name of the subreddit>
```
Example:
```
hey uni find a top post in r/aww
```

##### For new posts:

```
hey uni find a new post <in/on/from/within> <r/, /r/, or just the name of the subreddit>
```
Example:
```
hey uni find a new post in r/FloridaMan
```
###### Notes: If you want to have uni browse NSFW images set the channel's tag to be NSFW
## Usage of the inspiro bot module
```
hey uni inspire me
```
that's about it

#####
## Usage of the derpibooru module
##### To search for an image on derpibooru do
```
hey uni search on <derpi/derpibooru> <tags provided here>
```
#####


Example:
```
hey uni search on derpi artist:rodrigues404
```
Or
```
hey uni search on derpibooru first_seen_at.gt:3 days ago AND score.gte:77
```
#####
#####
##### To see the results of an image on derpibooru do
```
hey uni derpi image <ID of image>
```
Example:
```
hey uni derpi image 1761475
```

###### Notes: Uni will set a channel's filter to be "everything" if the channel is marked "NSFW" and has no set filter

## Usage of the minigames module
||This part has not been developed yet||


## Usage of the unibucks module
Made entirely for fun as well but you could let your gambling habits go wild here

```
#####
Someone being a little annoying or just anything that gets him/her banned?
#####
Well uni is able to use the ban hammer ability in case you want uni to do so
```
